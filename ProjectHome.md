Bit is a program to track all the birds in a pet store's inventory. In later versions it can upload photos of the bird. Also, it can keep a record of all injuries and shots for the birds. It is made to also work online so customers can look up a bird over their comoputer and go to the store and look at the bird. Another function is that the program can print barcodes to put a small foot-band on the bird, scan it, and bring up and print the information.
